## If Memory Serves

If memory serves is an open source game created by a group of researchers that attended the ACM Annual Conference of Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2017). The game revolves around teaching undergraduates pointers and was designed using a learning outcome-based approach. This allowed for a game that facilitated educational games development within computer science. 

This project is to port “If memory serves” to an open source games engine (we have chosen Godot) as it is currently being developed on Unity.

## Project Set-up

To run this project you will need to install the latest version of Mono and GoDot 3.0.

[Mono Project](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)

[GoDot 3.0](https://godotengine.org/download/windows)

[Link to the Project Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/James120393/Godot-Porting-Project/tree/master)

Once these are installed/extracted, just open the "project.godot" file located inside the project folder. 
Then when prompted locate and select the Godot executable that came with the engine.

The project should then launch.


## Controls for the Game:

### Player 1 (Top Player, Addy)

Up, Down, Left, Right  == Movement

Right Shift == Pick-up Object
