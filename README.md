### For my coontribution to the game I added the following:

The main gameplay loop

Constructing of the levels

Porting of art assets

Game controls

Level goals


### Of the classes, I created:

Player 1&2.gd

Container.gd

Game.gd

Level Selector.gd

Menu.gd

Text.gd

Line.gd

Area.gd

## Controls for the Game:

### Player 1 (Top Player, Addy)

Up, Down, Left, Right  == Movement

Right Shift == Pick-up Object

Enter/Return == Place Object

### Player 2 (Bottom Player, Val)

W, A, S, D == Movement

Q == Pick-up Object

To Place an object as Player 2, the player must move to the desired area just below the counter.
